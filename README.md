# Tasks
1. Add learning rate schedulers to training pipeline
2. Add more options for optimizers: `Adam`, `RMSProp`, `RAdam`, ...
3. Add more options for classification metrics: `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `F1 score`, `FBeta score`, `auc`. Understand them.
4. Try out different pretrained models from `torchvision.models` for classifier tasks to improve performance.
5. Utilizer Tensorboard to log: `train loss`, `validation loss`, `learning rate`, `metrics`.
6. Achieve 91% Accuracy on this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/playlist/men-women-classification
