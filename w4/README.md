# Tasks
1. (Continue) Add docstrings and demos to classifier module.
2. (Continue) Create a module that automatically create a U-net based model that can accept different backbones in its encoder (VGG, Resnet, Densenet, Efficientnet, ...).
3. Create a performance comparison table between backbones, hyperparameters, requireds: VGG, Resnet, Densenet, Efficientnet.
4. Learn and implement Focal Loss.
5. Achieve 80% dicescore on w3 test set.

Week4:
- Code backbone resnetTemplate, densenetTemplate
- Code efficientnet, densenet vgg
- Train and compair result, experiments with multi lr-scheduler and lr, backbone
